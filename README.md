# Bogstandard Nonsense
Collection of short texts on various subjects of author's interest.

If this repository gains enough textual weight it will be refactored into a blog format, but until then I hope you enjoy the mess of topics found here.

## Contents
- [Absurd Gödel](https://github.com/bogstandard/nonsense/blob/main/Absurd-Gödel.md) – Method of writing numbers in an ridiculous way using only prime numbers and a single character, like this **<sub><sub>A</sub>A<sup>A</sup></sub>A**!
- [Substituting GW Scatter & Artillery Dice with D10 (sort of)](https://github.com/bogstandard/nonsense/blob/main/GW-Scatter-Artillery-Dice-D10-Substitution.md) – Outlines a system of using a single D10 dice as substitute for a set of Games Workshop Scatter & Artillery Dice with a focus of probability accuracy. This is system is long-winded, daft and best ignored.
