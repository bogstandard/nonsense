Match Report

The remnants of The Mordheim Firefighters & Lamplighters Guild (or what remains within their “tallow” suits) entered the ruined suburb from the east, while unbeknownst to them a family of Halfings; Survivors of Sommershire, did similar to the west. 

The Firefighters immediately lost Captain Pointer to a hail of arrows, caught off guard in the open. Henchman “Stovepipe” attempted a return with his rifle, and missed. More Halfings moved up to harass the gentle Tallow Men, who continued to returned fire. One Halfing took two bolts to the helmet, but sprung right back up from the knockdown. Meanwhile two others halfings strung up young recruit “Squat” behind an outhouse, retiring him promptly. Desperate, the remaining brave firemen (who are most definitely not ghoulish!) returned continuous volleys until finally striking the grandfather of the family, fatally wounding him for good. The Tallow Men’s attempts at stealing away the Halfling Captain’s daughter came to naught and cost them dearly; their warlock “T-Bone”, catching an arrow to the eye having fumbled his spell book.

Leaking precious fluids, the Tallow Men retreated to a nearby tavern and by chance, came upon some rather medicinal ales; making a full recovery. The Halflings came out unscathed, except Grandpa who’s firmly under the top soil - a high price for ambushing your humble local lamp lighters.
