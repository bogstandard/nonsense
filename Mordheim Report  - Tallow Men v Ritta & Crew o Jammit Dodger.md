Just Some Routine Pest Contro–ARRRGHH

The Mordheim Firefighters & Lamplighters Guild, or Tallowmen as they were affectionately known by humble once-alive locals, sometimes have to take side gigs to keep the fuel burning. Mad Baron Ol’ Cumbridge complained his steelworks had been overrun by rats, again, five rooms to clear and a wyrdstone reward. It’s a wonder the Works are still going, or in his head at least. Jobs a job though! How hard could it be?

The rats were larger than expected, and armed too. “Stovepipe” tried his best to get a few rifle shots off but his hangover made him wobble. The crossbow troops proved equally strung out. Wasnt long before melee had to be had, that didnt go well either.

Stove’ took multiple hits from a wyrdstone pistol, somehow surviving a bit longer, getting up each time. Captain Pointer got knocked out and fell 16ft, he’s completely mad now and sustained 6 permanent wounds from the bone crunching falls, then being beaten by rat’s clubs as he lay unconscious and broken. 

Enjoying the carnage a bit too much one of the rats tried a diving charge and briefly crippled himself from 12ft drop. Providing some light comedy before 3 of his mates then kicked “Birdhouse” to near death while he also lay facedown in the dirt. 

For one turn of the clock all four of the Tallowmen left in the fight lay wounded - they were already three down, while the rats partied with violence on the helpless sods. Stomping and beating wounded public servants. 

The firefighters did their best to clear the Steelworks, all got knocked out the fight. Two dead and not much to show for it. The Baron of course, wasnt too pleased, refused to pay at first, but after some gentle talking to - he forked over four wyrdstone shards for the Guild’s trouble.
